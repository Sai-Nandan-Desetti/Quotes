            I love good writing. Don't ask me what do I mean by "good". I can't define it.
          </p>
          <p>             
            Anyway, here's a collection of writings that not just impressed but <i>inspired</i> me--
            the few remaining drops as I scoop water from the ocean in my tiny hands and pour into this container.

                        You call yourself a free spirit, a wild thing. And you're terrified somebody's going to stick you in a cage.
                        Well... you're already in that cage. You built it yourself. And it's not bounded in the West... or in the East...
                        It's wherever you go. Because no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.

                        I had come home, yes. But home had changed. And I would always be in between-- South, North... East, West... Peace, America... Vietnam, America.
                        It is my fate to be in between heaven and earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we resist our fate, we suffer. When we accept our fate, we are happy. We have time in abundance, an eternity to make mistakes.
                        But we need only once correct our mistake and at last hear the song of enlightenment with which we can break the chain of vengeance forever.
                        In your heart you can hear it now... It's the song your spirit has been singing since the moment of your birth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the monks were right, and nothing happens without cause, then the gift of suffering is to bring us closer to God...
                        To teach us to be strong when we are weak;
                        To be brave when we are afraid;
                        To be wise in the midst of confusion;
                        To let go of that which we can no longer hold...
                        Lasting victories are won in the heart, not in this land or that...

                        It was like we (me and my father) was both back in older times... and I was on horseback goin'
                        through the mountains of a night...
                        Goin' through this pass in the mountains...
                        It was cold and there's snow on the ground. He rode past me and kept on goin'.
                        Never said nothing goin' by. He just rode on past...
                        He had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down. When he rode past, I seen he was carrying fire in a horn... the way people used to do...
                        And I could see the horn from the light inside of it-- about the color of the moon.
                        And in the dream I knew that he was goin' on ahead... and that he's fixing to make a fire somewhere...
                        Out there in all that dark and all that cold...
                        I knew that whenever I got there, he'd be there...
                        Then I woke up.
