## Aedh Wishes For The Cloths of Heaven
WB Yeats

Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,<br>
Enwrought with golden and silver light,<br>
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths<br>
Of night and light and the half light,<br>
I would spread the cloths under your feet:<br>
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;<br>
I have spread my dreams under your feet;<br>
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
