```
In the Preamble's Pope it lies scrambled;
It has enabled and disabled
Revolutions and political empires.
As the nation is shrouded in darkness
It nurses in its heart a desire,
A Hope - O! plenty of it -
A hope to see some light.
It alone can strengthen
The four cripple Leos.
Unfurl the Tricolour high above.
For it is the embodiment of power
In India - the world's largest democracy.
[Unleash the power it heralds
And victory is certain to be yours.]
```
