```
If there is righteousness in the heart, there will be beauty in the character;
If there is beauty in the character, there will be harmony in the home;
If there's harmony in the home, there will be order in the nation;
When there is order in the nation, there will be peace in the world.
```

God cannot be won by tricks or shortcuts. He can be won only through love and detachment.
