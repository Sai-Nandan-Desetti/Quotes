```
It is a tree sown with the seeds of SANCTIMONY,
With creepers of CORRUPTION climbing all over it.
Inherent in it is INGRATITUDE for the people
Who toil tirelessly while the TRAITORS at the top,
Intolerant to the delusioned masses, create ILLUSIONS of
Concern and love - LIES let loose upon our lives - lest they lose
Their seats of OPULENCE oppressively gained from us
With disregard to the Preamble and POWER they contain.


Today, our traditions have been destroyed;
The meaning of our scriptures has been lost in the womb of time;
The significance of our culture has been misinterpreted and INVERTED;
It is the source of evil that has polluted this world--
The BEGINNING of it all.
