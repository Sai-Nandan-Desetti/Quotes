```
I run. I live.
And ‘times I wish I did neither.
Yet today I run.

To the rising sun painting the sky,
With the rising crop swaying in the breeze;
To the soothing silence of the world’s cries,
With the sweetening tweets atop the trees.

I rise. I fly.
And I always wished I could either.
Yet today I run.

To a song whose words I cannot place,
With devotion I place in my heart;
To flowers— red, purple, and yellow— blossoming with grace,
Within a yellow one, broken, I find art.

I pause. I tire.
And ‘times I wish I could quit.
Yet today I run.

To my final lap,
With a yellow flower;
To reach within the hour,
With a petal lost in nature’s lap.

Still breathing. Still blooming.

I run. I live.
And ‘times I wish I did neither.
Yet today I ran.
And lived to find the day brighter.
