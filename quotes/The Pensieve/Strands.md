```
As we mmust be just in our ambitions,
We must find truth in our innocence.
Else man cannot survive - against his own nature,
And evil will mature.
```

```
Oh! What is brighter than the light?
What is darker than the night?
What is keener than an axe?
What is softer than melting wax?

Truth is better than the light;
Falsehood is darker than the night;
Revenge is keener than an axe;
Love is softer than melting wax.
```
