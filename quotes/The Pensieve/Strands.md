As we mmust be just in our ambitions,
We must find truth in our innocence.
Else man cannot survive-- against his own nature--
And evil will mature.

The play of an act, in many ways, is characterized by the flow of waves-- smooth, continuous, irresistible, unstoppable, and vicissitudinous.
But as I stand here, gazing at the sparkling water, I cannot help but wonder--
Who directs the flow? How did it begin? How will it end?
and any quest for an answer only compels to acknowledge the presence of a force--
too great for my description,
too complex for my comprehension,
yet so inevitable to my experience.

A man said to a boy, "Son, listen when I tell you that fire burns."
The boy replied, "I will, when I get burnt."
"But why allow it burn you?"
"Ah! I don't allow it burn me. I only allow it to make me shine."
