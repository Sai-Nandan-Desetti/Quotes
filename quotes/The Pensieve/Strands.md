```
As we must be just in our ambitions,
We must find truth in our innocence.
Else man cannot survive— against his own nature
And evil will mature.

The play of an act, in many ways, is characterized by the flow of waves— smooth, continuous, irresistible, unstoppable, and vicissitudinous.
But as I stand here, gazing at the sparkling water, I cannot help but wonder &mdash;
Who directs the flow? How did it begin? How will it end?
and any quest for an answer only compels to acknowledge the presence of a force—
too great for my description,
too complex for my comprehension,
yet so inevitable to my experience.
