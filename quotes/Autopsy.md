Attorney (A); Doctor (D)

```
A: Doctor, how many of your autopsies you performed on dead people?
D: All of them. The live ones put up too much of a fight.
```

```
A: Do you recall the time that you examined the body?
D: The autopsy started aorund by 8:30pm.
A: And Mr. Denton was dead at the time?
D: If not, he was by the time I finished.
```

```
A: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse?
D: No.
A: Did you check for blood pressure?
D: No.
A: Did you check for breathing?
D: No.
A: Sir, then is it possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy?
D: No.
A: How can you be so sure, Doctor?
D: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.
A: But could the patient have still been alive?
D: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practising law!
