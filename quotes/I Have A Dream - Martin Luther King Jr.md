```
Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.
Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolated valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.
Now is the time to life our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.
