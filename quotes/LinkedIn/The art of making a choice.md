# The art of making a choice

Sometimes people complain about how much choice there is.

“I can’t decide! There’s too much! We only need the good ones!”

I can never understand this. Although apparently studies have shown that people are more likely to make, say, a jam purchase if there are three options than a dozen.

All this tells me is that people are weird.

When I go to buy jam, I like as much choice as possible, and manage it like this:

My wife and son like strawberry. I’ve tried them with others, and they still like strawberry best. So that’s most of the choices eliminated already. Even if they didn’t, there are a lot we won’t like.

We’re a bit fussy about ingredients, so I check those and eliminate some more. By now there probably aren’t many left out of all that vast and bewildering array.

Then it’s down to the sugar/fruit balance and price, which brands we know and like or dislike, and what’s on offer.

If there are still some that rank equally, then the decision is random because it might as well be. After all, if one of them was the only one that was there then I’d be picking it anyway, so having others makes no difference.

Isn’t this what everybody does, in one way or another?

And if someone else gets their way, and the jam is restricted to their three favourites of cherry, blackcurrant and sugar-free plum, I’m going home without any. Choice is how we all get to choose.
