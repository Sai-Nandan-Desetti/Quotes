## Memories are still fresh 

Ever since I started writing on LinkedIn, I wanted to write about a dear friend of mine.

I met her at the therapy center where my son had his sessions.
It was an institute for special needs children.
Therapies were provided under the guidance of skilled and certified therapists. There were kids with various disabilities.
Every time I looked at them, my sorrows felt less miserable.
The hardships they went through bearing those smiles...How come?

Sometime I questioned God, silently watching those kids while they dispersed after their sessions finished.

There was a boy, in a gang of 4 boys, who sang well, the one who sang loudest was always cheered by the other 3. 
"Papa kehte hain bada naam karega", was their song.
Pure innocence, no filters.
That's probably the best example of an innocence filled friendship I have ever witnessed.

My daughter was just 5 months old and she used to be in my lap most of the time.
Slowly, other moms who used to come and wait for their kids' therapies became my friends.
We would talk in the garden outside while the kids were busy with their therapies.

Among them was Smita, the one with the broadest smile.
Sometimes I envied her: how could she bear that smile always on her face? Didn’t her cheeks hurt with the strain? 
She had solutions to almost all of my problems, if it was a cough she would take out some cloves from her tiny pouch and hand over a few asking me to chew them.
If sad and tired, she would hand over cardamoms instead.
Almost for every problem, she had a fix inside her pouch.

She had twins: Aadya and Atharv. Aadya was blind from birth and Atharv had just one eye. Smita said this was because they were IVF kids.
Something happened during her third trimester of pregnancy and Aadya lost her vision. 

She always used to tell her tales of hardship, how her mother-in-law troubled her for 5 long years, till one day her husband took the decision of living apart from his mother.
That is when they decided to go for IVF as natural conception was difficult for her due to her health issues. 
She always worried about Aadya and I could sense her softness for her.
Smita loved my daughter too. She used to play with her whenever she was awake, and vice versa, Aadya loved me.
I don't know how but she would recognize my voice from a distance and would ask Smita to take her to me where we played.
She made me sing songs for her: 
"Chhu kar mere mann ko.. Kiya tune kya ishara.."
She loved it and always asked me to sing it for her. 
Often she would hold my hands and ask me to dance with her.
Smita said that Aadya even remembered me at home and smiled and sang to the song at times.

Then, Covid happened. We were all locked indoors. My son’s therapy stopped. After almost a year we moved to another city.
On 26th March, Smita called me to check if I was settled in the new place. I replied yes but couldn’t talk much.
I was busy unpacking our luggage. 
I hung up with my last few words with Aadya promising to call back once everything is fixed in the new house. 
I called back on 20th April. She didn't answer. I thought she would call back, maybe she was busy, but she never called. 
1st May, I got a call from another friend from the same circle. She said, Smita succumbed to Covid on 4th April. 
I panicked, wanting to speak to her desperately, knowing that I won't be able to do so, ever.
I called many times to speak to Aadya and Atharv.
Finally, Atharv spoke to me once, and then probably my number was erased from that mobile, but my memories are still fresh and will always remain so.
