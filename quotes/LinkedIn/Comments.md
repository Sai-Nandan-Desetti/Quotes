    > In my darkest moments, I realized that even as I was shedding tears of betrayal, I was trusting something;
  Even as I was angry that I was all alone, I was holding onto something.
  I chose to call it God.
  You can choose to call it anything. You can choose to find it anywhere.
  In the words you write to heal, in the courage you (A) took to reach out, in the help you extend to strangers... 
  But if you choose to find it in my mere words, then you have an incredible gift of goodness, don't you?
  I pray that goodness dissolves the screams of your nightmares into the soft rustling of leaves on a peaceful night. 
  I pray that goodness gives you the strength to wake up to the rising sun waiting to embrace you...

    > Just yesterday I finally got down to watch Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. As usual, Bollywood does its own dance with a serious subject.
But it made me think, as does your post now, about "true love", one-sided love, honesty, trust, relationships... 
Some people think only a family needs our every effort to get it to stay.
Some think a friendship requires it too.
Some think even a family doesn't need it, only "true love" deserves it.
And no-one can define what "true love" is...

    > Sometimes I see life as a puzzle to solve, 
Sometimes I see it as an emotion to experience, 
Sometimes I see it as a pain to bear, 
Sometimes I see it as a scream to let out, 
Sometimes I see it as a memory to cherish, 
Sometimes I see it as a gift to be opened, 
Everytime I see it as a moment to be lived. 
Until I don't.
