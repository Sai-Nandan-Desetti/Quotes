# Ripples
I am generally not a fan of days that dictate our thoughts but today is something else.
It is the International day for Mother Language.
For us Bengalis, it is Ekushe, or the 21st. A reminder for many values at once. And once again, I am in a throwback mood.

Many many moons ago, this used to be me.
And I haven’t had many moments in my life where I was genuinely proud of my singing days.
But this show gave me one.
This show was from 2013. When I was battling vocal cord nodules for more than a year already.
But I still sang because Baba was adamant that I do.

And years later in 2017, when my friend Neha and I were traveling in Rome and were in the Vatican, a person in a Kiosk recognised me.
He asked me if I was a musician and appeared on this show, back in 2013.
I was stunned to find that he had remembered my name, my face, my voice and this song.
We hugged, chatted and are still in touch via social media.

Till date, whenever I feel like whatever I do has no consequence or relevance, I think of that day in the Vatican.
In 2013, I wasn’t aware of how many people’s hearts art could touch.
In 2017, I learnt the lesson.
Ever since, I have tried to remain true to every thing I do.
Because we never know who might just remember it for a long time.
That’s my lesson for Ekushe, 2024 too.
