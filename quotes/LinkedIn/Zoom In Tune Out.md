## Zoom In Tune Out

Lately, it occurs to me that getting an accurate impression of something requires two things: zoom in and tune out.

Let's say something crazy happens. Call it a store being torched by some local thugs next to your favorite supermarket. Y'know since that actually happened this morning. Apparently, the store offered service that certain people didn't like. Since the law disagreed, these certain people took care of things themselves. They destroyed the store and a good deal of the surrounding stores.

Zooming in means getting really up close and empathetic. Feeling what's going on. It's not just a statistic. It's people. Someone's livelihood went up in smoke! A bunch of other people who weren't even involved are out big chunks of money as well.

I want to punch someone in the nose.

That's the right initial response, I think. That's zooming in, feeling the pain viscerally, feeling a biting sense of injustice that needs to be righted.

Unfortunately for me, the noses of the people responsible are currently unavailable. Also, while breaking said noses would feel really good (for me, at least), it would not un-torch the store. So it might be a valid punishment, but that doesn't help the victims much. ALSO also, I'd probably get arrested, which is generally not my preferred outcome.

This is the "tuning-out" stage. Once you've established a human connection, and you feel the weight of it all, you have to stop. Pull back and consider things logically. Our initial gut reaction is very often unhelpful, even if it comes from the right place.

People frequently struggle with one or the other of these two. Sometimes you get people who are incredibly riled up over something they read, or see, or whatever. They're marching and fighting almost the second they find out. They're all in.

But they never stop to analyze what they're all in FOR. They don't double-check the situation to make sure their take on the situation is accurate. They don't ask what else is going on that might be relevant. And they don't take the critical step - of asking if their proposed solution is at all effective.

What's worse, if YOU try to take these steps, such people will assume that you don't want justice. You're not standing up against the problem? Then YOU'RE the problem! You don't want to help because you support the bad guy!

On the other hand, you get people who refuse to acknowledge the human aspects of a situation at all. They look down on you for your "weakness" if you succumb. They accuse you of being a drama queen if you're moved.

Such people don't feel much about the human pain involved. So they don't care much about what happens. Their favorite response is always to just shrug and say, "that's life."

They like to do nothing.

If you want a real, meaningful take on anything, you have to feel. And then you have to NOT feel. You have to "get" how serious something is, but then consider it carefully and without emotional bias.

Otherwise, you'll never get it right.
