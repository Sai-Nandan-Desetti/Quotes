## What's it like living in a war?

Oddly, it's very like living in a not-war. Only different.

I'm not in the middle of the fighting. I'm close enough to sometimes hear the booms, and we've had to run to shelters a few times in the past few weeks, but otherwise it's pretty calm here. So I can't comment on the hell that those poor folks are going through. It's a completely different set of experiences, and I'm not qualified to open my mouth about it.

But here, just a short distance away from that world, is something else entirely. People are out in the streets. The weather is nice. Stores are open. In spite of a literal war on our doorstep, it's business as usual.

Only not.

We still go to work, shop, do laundry. We still eat meals. Our children are back to remote learning, which sucks big time, but of course that's nothing compared to what's going on just an hour's drive from my house.

The major difference, for us, seems to be that all this peace, all this normalcy, could disappear in an instant. And we wouldn't know it until it was too late.

All around me, people are preparing for invasion. We have armed guards in our synagogues. Folks are jury-rigging locks for bomb shelter doors in case ground troops rush through the city, looking for babies to dismember for their live-stream. Don't think it could happen? It just did to our brothers, so close you can almost feel it. So yeah, we have no idea what to expect.

There's a sort of hum of anxiety as everyone goes about daily life. Will today be the same as yesterday? Will the wail of a siren interrupt us for a few minutes? Will a rocket destroy a home and the people inside?

Worse, will bloodthirsty killers suddenly march through our streets looking for the weakest, most defenseless among us as easy victims?

But in the meantime, it's quiet. Eerily quiet. So normal it makes you want to scream.

And suddenly, I think to myself, that's not unlike any other day.

There's ALWAYS the chance that tragedy will strike. It could be illness, or an accident in the kitchen. A car crash. Heck, we've lived in the shadow of terror for ages. And in the meantime, we always try to live life. so what's changed? The only difference now is how palpable it is.

So while we do all the things we need to do to stay safe, the rest of the day is still a day. It's still life. And we should still live it.

What are we supposed to do differently when a sword hangs over our heads? Obviously, we need to pray. We need to send every spare ounce of time, money, and supplies to wherever it's needed. But to be honest, we should always be praying hard, and always giving as much as we can.

If we need to give our best efforts now, it's only because that's the way it should always be. We have a limited amount of seconds in this world. It might be millions, or it might only be a few dozen. Either way, they all count, and we need to do spend them in the best way possible.
