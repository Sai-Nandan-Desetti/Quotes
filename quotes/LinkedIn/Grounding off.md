## Grounding off

> "Let the youth once learn to take a straight shaving off a plank, or draw a fine curve without faltering, or lay a brick level in its mortar, and he has learned a multitude of other matters which no lips of man could ever teach him." — John Ruskin

If you know me on LinkedIn, you know Harry W., probably.

I don’t know half of what he’s done in his career, but it’s a lot more high-powered than anything I’m ever involved in – international finance and regulation, the rooms where consequential things happen. Rarified stuff.

But I thought of him when I read this quote because, unusually these days, he’s also a craftsman.

I was told, growing up – approvingly – that certain cultures ensure their children have “a trade” before doing anything professional. For security, mostly, I thought.

But I do firmly believe that if you have never done anything with your hands, there are things about the world you will never understand in the way practical people do. And we seem to have lost that, the last vestiges of it being when we decided that everybody should go to university.

I’m not sure what we do about it, but many things would be better if more of our high-fliers were like Harry. You can’t fool a physical object, or bullshit it, and that grounding rubs off in areas where appearance and theory can feel like the only things that matter.
