## Why do I run?

I ask myself this question many times. Especially on days when the shoes feel tight, the feet throb, and the back threatens to give way. Every step feels torturous when you can lie in bed, comfortable with a cup of morning coffee. 

And to a larger extent, I ask myself this question of life, too. Why do I live? 

There has never been an answer to both.

I run. I live. And many days, I wish I didn't do both.

But today, it seems okay to just run and live because you are here, and you don't know what else to do. 

The sun was barely setting up its palette in the sky when I set out.

I turn onto a road I usually avoid for the dogs. But today, the dogs leave me alone. Wheat stalks wave gently in a slow breeze. 

I run to silence. No music. No podcasts. But I hear birds. So many of them, singing the tune without words.

People clad in black prostrate in front of an Ayyappan temple. A Tamil song in the background, words I can't recognize, but devotion I can place. 

Cows munch on grass, comfortable and snug, giving me a pitying look for running for no reason.

I run by a lake, waters glistening with the morning stillness. A duck waddles patiently. A birdwatcher sits equally patiently, a long-lens camera waiting for the birds. Two men take selfies on a little bridge.

I see flowers, red, purple, and yellow. They look splendid and perfect. But it's a broken yellow one that I caress. The one I love the most. One petal lost asunder in the night's battle. Yet here still.

And no less beautiful.

The silence turns into chaos when I get back to the highway. The gentle sun is now fierce. My mind, which was never quiet, struggles even more to finish the last 5 km. 

Yet, I remember that little broken flower. And run. Because sometimes, this is the reason, isn't it?

We live because it's glorious to be alive, even when it isn't. 

We run because it's glorious to move, even when it doesn't feel so.

Today and all days, I send you flowers and some meaning from this day.
