O Lord grant me
The serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
The courage to change the thinsg I can, and
The wisdom to know the difference.

I asked God to take away my pride.
God said, "No. It is not for Me to take away, but for you to give up."

I asked God to make my handicapped body whole.
God said, "No. Your spirit is whole. Your body is only temporary.

I asked God to grant me patience.
God said, "No. Patience is a by-product of tribulations; it isn't gained, it is earned."

I asked God to give me happiness.
God said, "No. I give you blessings, happiness is upto you."

I asked God to spare me pain.
God said, "No. Suffering draws you apart from worldly cares and brings you closer to Me."

I asked God for all things that I might enjoy life.
God said, "No. I give you life so you can enjoy all things.

I asked God to help me love others as much as He loves me.
And then God replied, "Ah! Finally you've asked what I've come to give."
