```
I've always believed in numbers, in the equations and logics that lead to reason.
But after a life time of such pursuit, I ask, 'What truly is logic? Who decides reason?'
My quest has taken me through the physical, the metaphysical, to the delusional, and back.
And I've made the most important discovery of my career... of my life.
It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found.
I'm only here tonight because of you. You are the reason I am. You are all my reasons...
```

```
You don't know what's the truth...
Imagine... if you had suddenly learnt that the people and the places and the moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse&mdash; had never been...
What kind of a hell would that be?

Context: The Manhattan Project

William Parcher (WP) 
John Nash (JN) 

WP: (The project and it's consequences) is not that simple, you know. 
JN: Well, you ended the war. 
WP: We incinerated 150,000 people in a single heart beat. 
JN: Great deeds come at great cost, Mr. Parcher. 
WP: Conviction, it turns out, is a luxury of those on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.
