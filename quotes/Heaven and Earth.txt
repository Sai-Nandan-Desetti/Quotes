Don't ask what is right or wrong. These questions are very dangerous.
Right is only the goodness you carry in your heart...
Wrong is all that comes between you and that (you truly) love.

We're the same... We have made bad karma. And our sould debt will come due, if not in this life, then in another.
But we can't give up. We must try.

Tears are God's way of paying you back for what He's taken. I have no more tears. I have cried them out to all directions of the wind.

...I love her as a sister, but I cannot accept her gifts.
It's been so many years... Much is forgiven. But you don't understand how much suffering Americans caused here. Things were very hard.
We used our own excrement to grow vegetables. All we had to hold onto was the future because we knew that future would not arrive unless we won.
So, we kept dying, no matter what; just like ants beneath an elephant. It wasn't because we were brave. (It was) because we had no choice.
Our freedom was all... All that mattered.
But when the future finally came-- there was more war.

Rebuilding a nation after starting a war is like to trying to start a family by getting raped.
