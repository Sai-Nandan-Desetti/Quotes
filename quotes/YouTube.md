    > There are two kinds of scientific progress: the methodical experimentation and categorization which gradually extend the boundaries of knowledge, and the revolutionary leap of genius which redefines and transcends those boundaries. Acknowledging our debt to the former, we yearn, nonetheless, for the latter.


* [Isaac Asimov on The David Letterman Show, October 21, 1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=365kJOsFd3w)
    > There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge. - Isaac Asimov

    > You have to prepare for it... but... the moment of discovery is the moment when thinking stops... you become that truth that you are seeking. - Edward Frenkel

    > A thinker without purpose is a lover without passion.

    > We don't believe in something because it's true. It's true to us because we believe it.


* [How Carl Sagan "Predicted" 2020... in 1995](https://youtu.be/LNQtB5sL9F4)
    > We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good. - Carl Sagan

    > And I think that the more that you do something the better that you become at it, the more confident that you feel in it, the more that you enjoy it, the more that it becomes a playground rather than a chore. And that is a tidal wave that I've been riding ever since. - Hannah Fry

    > Minimalism is so hard to nail. Most times you just end up with a song that's too "basic". But in the hands of the right composer, minimalism's strongest quality is that, in its simplicity, it creates a direct line straight to one's core. No fluff, no bells and whistles, just a series of notes that, through their slight variation and careful repetition, form the closest thing I can liken to "code" for the human psyche. It really taps into something; some people say it's sad, others happy, but really, I think, just like the genre itself, it's simpler than that-- it's emotion itself.

    > It took me four days to learn the song. But it will take me a lifetime to know how he composed it.

    > Life is so hard sometimes. You were born into a broken home and it wasn't your fault. So many adversities so much struggle for the next 20 yrs. Many bad memories. You try to forget then u listen to this song and everything comes back and rains on you. No one hands you an umbrella. No one gives a fuck about you. You cant connect with anyone. You wanna cry when your supposed to but you cant. Why me? This song brings every feel out of me. Hopeless, sadness, determination, anger, vengeance....this song can make me cry when I close my eyes this song can make me lift weight I was never able to lift before. This song makes me feel its okay to cry  but its not okay to give up. We must never give up. Because someone or some force, something I cannot explain is rooting for me to keep going. I feel it.

* [A Conversation with Bertrand Russell (1952)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL_sMXfzzyA)
    > Well, if I were an omnipotent and a purely benevolent spirit, who got it in his/her/its head to create beings such as ourselves, I would create them without the desire to do something called 'evil', or the capability to inflict or experience anything called 'suffering'. (Pure benevolence and omnipotence are logically incompatible, since a being of perfect goodness could not choose to invent evil.) Since this god could presumably design the nature of his creations to be anything he chose, why would he offer them even the choice of such awful things? Who is he trying to impress? Himself? And I'm leaving aside the whole batty notion of offering up his son, who is also himself, as a scapegoat for the evils of beings he created to be capable of evil. None of it makes the slightest sense if you think about it for even one moment, it's totally unintelligible...
