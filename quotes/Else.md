> I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. - Isaac Newton

Oh! What is brighter than the light?
What is darker than the night?
What is keener than an axe?
What is softer than melting wax?

Truth is better than the light;
Falsehood is darker than the night;
Revenge is keener than an axe;
Love is softer than melting wax.

Were toiling upward in the night.
