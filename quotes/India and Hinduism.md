> The Hindus feel that in India there can be no place for anyone except the Hindus, and if the non-Hindues, especially the Muslims, wished to live here they should either be killed or made to live as slaves to the Hindus. They think that this will assure an undisputed reign of Hinduism, not realizing (sadly) that this is, verily, the death of Hinduism. - Mahatma Gandhi

> Our country-- a microcosm of human history, a repository of all experience, an archive of all knowledge, a catalogue of all atrocity, and a beacon of all wisdom; this land we call by its customary names, Bharat or Hindustan; this idea we call India; this dearly beloved hom of ours on a plaanet whoose very survival is today in question-- what has it come to? Did we exercise our franchise to lynch the weak, to murder minorities, to defend the killers of Mahatma Gandhi? Is that what our vaunted civilization was all about? Is this how it ends? - Ananya Vajpeyi
