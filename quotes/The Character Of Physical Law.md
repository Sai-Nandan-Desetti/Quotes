* Newton’s ideas about space and time agreed with experiment very well, but in order to get the correct motion of the orbit of Mercury, which was a tiny, tiny difference, the difference in the character of the theory needed was enormous. The reason is that Newton’s laws were so simple and so perfect, and they produced definite results. In order to get something that would produce a slightly different result, it had to be completely different. In stating a new law, you cannot make imperfections on a perfect thing; you have to have another perfect thing.

* You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity... The inexperienced, and crackpots, and people like that, make guesses that are simple, but you can immediately see that they are wrong, so that does not count. Others, the experienced students, make guesses that are very complicated, and it sort of looks as if it is all right. But I know it is not true because the truth always turns out to be simpler than you thought. What we need is imagination... We have to find a new view of the world that has to agree with everything that is known, but disagree in its predictions somewhere, otherwise it is not interesting; and, in that disagreement, it must agree with nature.
